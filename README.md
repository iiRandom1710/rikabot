# RikaBot

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/npm.svg)]()

RikaBot was made out of boredom and desperation by a Discord user with no life.

Currently, RikaBot's sole capability is posting the same picture of Rika every hour, hence her Discord username.

This is initialised via entering the ``%berika`` command.

Scratch that, RikaBot can now post the same picture of Neru every hour as well. The ``%neru`` command is used to initialise this, though that was probably obvious to you anyways.

RikaBot relies on [discord.io](https://github.com/izy521/discord.io) to run.
